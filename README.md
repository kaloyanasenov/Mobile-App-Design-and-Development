# Food leftovers meal suggesting app

## What this app does?
The whole idea of this application is to combat food waste. The way it does it is by giving the user some suggestion on what meals they can make, by asking for one main ingredient. You can always go look back in your history for your last searches. Another additional function is random meal idea generation. 

## How to use the app?
The intended way is to open the index file in Chrome and with he inspect tool apply mobile view. From there you are using the app in its intended form. You can navigate with the tab bar at the bottom, write in text boxe and click the blue buttons.

## What tools have been used?
* HTML
* Ionic framework
* API- https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

## What can be improved?
* In the home page, after you get the meal suggestion the video link button is not working.
* In the history tab, the application can only store 1 string, by design it is supposed to be able to store multiple.
* In the suggestion tab, the video button is not possitioned correctly.
